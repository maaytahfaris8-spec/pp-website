<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>
    Basketball is known for being a game of skill, tactics, and intelligence. It teaches 
    players many important lessons that can be implemented in daily life, such as learning 
    to absorb pain, build discipline, and working hard strategically to achieve smart  and 
    effective results. Yet, one major issue that is underlined when it comes to basketball 
    is how also the mindset makes players feel isolated and become emotionally unavailable 
    due to their suppression of their emotions.

<h2>The Effects on The Court</h2>

<p>
Having such negligence and lack of awareness can lead to negative impacts on basketball 
players socially and personally inside and outside the court, like :
</p>

<li>- Performance Anxiety</li>
<li>- Fear of failing and disappointing others</li>
<li>- Experiencing social pressure from players, coaches, parents</li>
<li>- Facing an identity loss due to injuries</li>
<li>- Developing a sense of hatred towards your own sport</li>

<h2>The Effects Off the Court</h2>

<p>
Off the court, the negative effects follow players, even in their personal life outside 
basketball in which they experience things like :
</p>

<li>- Difficulty in expressing emotions</li>
<li>- Lack of support for mental health by teams</li>
<li>- Experiencing pressure to “ be grateful” for having the opportunity</li>
<li>- Having this constant lonely atmosphere, especially while recovering</li>
<li>- Developing various mental issues such as ADHD, OCD, or Depression</li>

<h2>The Antidote</h2>

<p>
Thus, moderate but effective solutions can be implemented to change one’s perspective and 
attitude towards everything around them, consequently imrpoving their mental health, like by :
</p>

<li>- Understand that strength relies on facing your pain and not hiding it. 
    All athletes, especially basketball players, can be both vulnerable and tough 
    since the two traits harmonize with each other rather than cancelling each 
    other out.</li>

<li>- Living everyday life with the acceptance that basketball isn’t your whole life, 
    but rather a part of it. This includes exploring and discovering new passions, 
    interests, and hobbies which can help build relationships which highlight how your 
    value exceeds your stats.</li>

<li>- Surround yourself with people who appreciate you for who you truly are and not as 
    a basketball player, as those people will stand with you during the highs and lows.</li>

<li>- Make it habit of regularly meeting with someone that could help provide support, 
    clarity, and understanding, like a counselor, mentor or coach. After all, mental 
    health training is a part of a basketball player’s training, and not a separate matter.</li>
