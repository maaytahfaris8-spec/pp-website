<h1>The Work on The Court</h1>

<p>
    Basketball relies on mastering the fundamentals. Skills such as shooting, 
    dribbling, passing, defense, and rebounding define great players from the rest. 
    In this webpage, the drills will focus on improving fundamentals and showing that 
    fundamentals, not flash, are the foundation of long-term growth on the court.

<h2>Shooting</h2>

    <p>
        <li>Form Shooting: Stand 1 – 1.5 m away from the rim and practice shooting the 
            ball with one hand, ensuring the ball is brought up in a straight line to eye 
            level and maintaining flow through by flicking the wrists and shooting with the 
            fingers to build muscle memory and improve both the consistency and accuracy of 
            your shooting.</li>
    </p>

<p>
    <li>5-4-3-2-1 Shooting Drill: Place 6 cones across the court. Place two cones below the rim, 
    two cones at each corner, one cone at the free-throw line, and one cone at the top of the 
    key line. Begin by scoring a layup from the right-side cone. Then, spin around the free-throw 
    line cone and do a left-handed layup. After that, sprint to the left-corner to shoot a 3-point 
    shot, before sprinting to the other corner and repeating the same process. Finally, sprint 
    towards the top of the key and end the drill with shooting a 3-point shot. This drill helps 
    players become more consistent and gain fitness to be able to take game-like shots when tired. 
    Do this drill for 2-3 sets or more depending on your ability.</li>

<h2>Passing</h2>

<p>
<li>Bounce / Chest Passing Drill: Have another player do this drill with you where each of you has a 
    ball. Begin by bouncing the ball two times and pass the with one hand as a bounce pass. Meanwhile, 
    the other player does the same routine as you. Repeat the same process doing chest passes while 
    making sure you alternate hands in both drills. Do these drills for about 30 – 45 seconds per hand. 
    Doing this drill is effective as it teaches the brain to handle various tasks at once while also 
    training both the mind and muscle on passing techniques that serve different purposes, depending on 
    the game situation.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>Wall Tosses: Grab your ball and stand about 2 – 2.5 m away from a smooth wall. Then, start passing the 
    ball to the wall with one hand and then catch it with the same hand. Try varying between the types of 
    passes like doing chest passes, bounce passes, over-head passes, etc.. Begin slowly then begin picking up 
    the pace by speeding up. Doing this drill teaches you how to accurately throw passes in the right direction, 
    power, and angle to return to your hands while also teaching you how to catch passes with one hand.</li>
</p>

<h2>Dribbling</h2>

<p>
<li>Dribbling Full-Court: Grab a ball and start dribbling full court at a slow pace at first with simple dribbles. Make sure your eyes are looking upwards, your body is low, and you’re balanced. Do this 3-4 times before changing to other movements like behind the back, between the legs, crossovers, and then combination of all the previous moves while also speeding up when it becomes easier. Such exercise is essential for building fitness, stamina, and training the muscles on how to work harmonically to control the ball through various movements that require flexibility, speed, and reaction-time.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>Dribble Pick-ups: Using the movements done in the exercise above, stand on the free throw or wherever is suitable for you and start by doing a combination of one crossover, followed by a between-the-leg, and then pick-up the ball as if you’re about to shoot it. Do this drill with both hands for 30 seconds before changing into another combination. Doing this drill helps teach players how to combine ball-handling to create the proper position that allows them to shoot the ball and training for game-like situations.</li>

<h2>Defense</h2>

<p>
<li>Zig-Zag Defensive Slides: Place several cones across a full court on the baseline, free-throw corner, half-court line, other free-throw corner, and other baseline. Make sure each cone is equally distanced from the other at the same angle. Start by sliding towards each cone by sliding and bringing your legs next to each other without them touching. Make sure you stay low in a squat-like position. Do this drill 5 times and rest for 30 seconds between every set. This drill benefits players by building fitness and strength in the leg’s muscles while also improving footwork, reaction time, and agility.</li>

<p>
<li>Close-out Drills: Bring a partner to help you in this drill. Have your partner stand in the mid-range area / 3-point area while you stand at the baseline. Then, sprint towards your partner as he shoots. Make sure you raise your hand high up without hitting your opponent and slowing down your steps as you reach the shooter to prevent the shooter from driving with the ball and beating you. This drill helps teach players how to incorporate the defensive stance into game situations by slowing down speed after sprinting and keeping your hand high. This drill also teaches players the importance of recovery and fast reaction time.</li>

<h2>Rebounding</h2>

<p>
<li>One Hand Reach: Stand about 2-3 meters away from a wall with your ball. Then, start throwing the ball towards the wall and catch it with one hand. Make sure you catch the ball with one hand using your fingertips and strength before gripping the ball tightly with both hands. This drill helps to mimic game-lie situations where you may not be able to use both hands as one hand might be used for boxing out a player.</li>

</div>

<p>
<li>Run Box: Use that same wall and turn at a 90 angle to where your left shoulder forms a perpendicular angle with the ball. Then, form another 90 angles with your left hand and raise to be on the same level of your shoulder and put it on the wall. Grabbing the ball with your other hand, bounce the ball as hard as you can on the ground and then jump towards the ball to rebound as if you’re rebounding a shot that is at a further place than you. This drill helps combine boxing out opponents and being able to catch rebounds the are farther away or more difficult.</li>
