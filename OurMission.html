    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

<p>
    Within our ‘ modern’ society today, many issues that other countries have embraced 
    and accepted are still underlined or not talked about enough. With sports, it’s the 
    same thing, as many people still view sports as mere hobbies with no true future, or 
    sometimes as distractions that obstruct both education and a social life. 

    Meanwhile, many players today see on social media the oppurtunities players from other 
    countries are receiving to become better, play on the next level, and possibly turn their 
    love for a sport into a career that can pay them. Yet, most players don’t know where to 
    start, how to train, when, or what to train due to a lack of awareness about what makes 
    great basketball players outside of basketball. 

    Therefore, I decided to investigate the effect of enhancing dietary needs and improving 
    mental health, in addition to increasing training sessions and intensity through conducting 
    interviews with experts, researching about the methods to improve the mental aspect through 
    videos, articles, and experiments in improving performance and overall skill as a basketball 
    player.

    This website was made by a basketball player for all basketball players to be a free guide for 
    them to develop and become better in a sport they so deeply love, acting as their “baseline” 
    for working in a smart and strategic way.
