<h1>The Importance of Nutrition</h1>

<p> 
    Basketball is known for being a demanding and high-energy sport, given the high levels of agility, 
    endurance, skill, speed and power needed for efficient performance. This requires athletes to maintain
    a healthy and nutritious lifestyle when it comes to nutrition and hydration in order to perform at the 
    best level, recover their bodies effectively, as well as to preserve and strengthen athletic capabilities.

    <h2>The Biggest Misconcepions</h2>

    <p>
Because most basketball players lack general knowledge about how to construct their nutrition, many misconceptions 
have become common which hinder basketball performance, such as :
        <li>- Not calculating their energy needs correctly</li>
        <li>- Relying solely on protein as a sole food item</li>
        <li>- Not taking adequate amount of protein</li>
        <li>- Not taking enough carbohydrates before and after training</li>
        <li>- Taking supplements mistakenly thinking that they will boost performance</li>
        <li>- They think they need extra protein shakes, while in most cases they actually don’t</li>

    </p>
    
    <h2>What are the most important nutrients basketball players need daily for performance and recovery ?</h2>

    <p>
        Basketball players need to fulfill the requirements for both the macro and micronutrients requirements. 
        Macronutrients’ needs include carbohydrates, protein and fat intakes.

        Meanwhile, micronutrients include minerals such as sodium, potassium, 
        magnesium and vitamins like vitamins C and B. Athletes need some functional foods or compounds such as caffeine, 
        carnitine and creatine for optimum performance and recovery.
    </p>

    <h2>How should basketball players balance carbohydrates, protein, and fats ?</h2>

    <p>
    As mentioned before, basketball players should bear in mind that the three macronutrients’ components should be 
    tightly balanced. First, they should calculate their protein requirements for maximum performance and muscle 
    recovery. It is calculated based on the intensity of exercise. 
        
    Usually, high intensity training is considered demanding, thus protein is given to accommodate 1.7-2g/kg from an 
    athlete’s weight. Then, also depending on the level of exercise, carbohydrates needs are calculated as the sole 
    source of energy for all athletes. It should be tightly balanced before and after exercise for both optimum 
    performance and excellent recovery.
        
    Fat is considered secondary to energy boosting as its metabolism takes time and is not considered as a fast source 
    of energy.
    </p>

    <h2>What should players eat before a game or practice for maximum energy ?</h2>

    <p> 
       They should eat one to two servings of complex carbohydrates with a protein source. Complex carbohydrates include 
       whole grain bread or cereal. They should have eaten their protein servings beforehand. A light snack of fruit and 
       milk is considered satisfactory.
    </p>


    <h2>How many hours before a game should meals or snacks be eaten ?</h2>

    <p>
       Heavy meals should be eaten before 3 to 4 hours. A light snack before a game has a huge advantage 
       of boosting energy. If a game lasts for more than two hours, another carbohydrate snack and a mineral 
       water that has some salts can help in extending the endurance of a player.
    </p>

    <h2>What foods are best for muscle recovery after intense games or training ?</h2>

    <p>
       Best foods for muscle recovery are usually protein sources especially casein, which is available in milk 
       and dairy.
    </p>


    <h2>What’s the best way to balance healthy eating with cravings or fast food availability ?</h2>

    <p>
       Athletes should eat same as a normal individual adapting a healthy lifestyle. Enjoying a free meal once 
       in a while in a non-game day once weekly can be a good practice.
